### Verification selection
{: .typography__h3 }

The federal process selects at random one-third of KCC's students for verification. Check your "Required Documents" on [Financial Aid Self-Service](https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/FinancialAid/Home){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } for required verification items. Please fill out every box. If the answer is zero, place a 0 in the box. If the answer is "not applicable," place "N/A" in the box. For independent students, if you do not have a spouse, just put a large X through the spouse boxes. Access financial aid forms on [MyKCC](https://my.kcc.edu/services/financialaid/Pages/default.aspx){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } and Financial Aid Self-Service.
