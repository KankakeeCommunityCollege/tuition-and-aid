question: "How do I maintain financial aid eligibility?"
order: 9
---

To maintain your eligibility to receive financial aid once you are enrolled at KCC, you must:

* Maintain the grade point average specified in the academic regulations in KCC's college catalog. The required GPA is based on the number of credit hours you have attempted.
* Maintain a completion rate of 67% for all hours attempted.
* Complete the program you started before attempting more than 150% of the hours required to complete that program.

This 150% is determined through the calculation of "attempted hours." They include:

* All courses taken at KCC and all transfer courses credited at KCC. Transfer hours that do not count toward completion of your program of study at KCC may be excluded from the calculation of attempted hours if an appeal is approved.
* Courses in which you remain enrolled at the end of the tuition refund period each semester, even if you later withdraw from these courses.
* Courses which are of a remedial or prerequisite nature, unless excluded through an approved appeal.
* If you change your program of study at KCC, you still will be judged under the 150% time frame established for your original program unless a Financial Aid Satisfactory Progress Appeal is approved. Consult a KCC advisor.
