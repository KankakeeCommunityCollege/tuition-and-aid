question: "What happens after I submit my FAFSA online?"
order: 5
---

* The federal processor will process your application and email you once it is done (This means it has been processed by the federal processor, but may have not been processed through the school.)
* Once KCC receives your application we will mail you an initial letter with guidance on what needs to be done next.
  * If you are selected for verification this means that the Office of Financial Aid needs additional information to make sure there are no errors. Specific information needed will be sent in the letter. Note that financial aid applications cannot be complete until all steps are completed.
* If all steps have been completed you will then receive a Financial Aid Award Letter with your qualifying award amounts.

**It may take between 2 weeks and 2 months from the time we receive your FAFSA to have your awards processed. Apply early!**
