#### What else affects financial aid awards?
{: .typography__h4 }

* Financial aid can only be awarded for courses that are required in your academic program.
* Financial aid is calculated based on enrollment status. Enrollment status may also be affected by limitations on repeated or remedial coursework.
* Attendance is mandatory for Title IV* financial aid eligibility.
  * You must be enrolled and attending each course by the posted refund date. Your registration statement has course refund dates.
  * By itself, logging in to an online course is not sufficient to demonstrate attendance. You must show participation, such as submitting an assignment or contributing to a discussion board.
* A failed or withdrawn course will negatively affect your financial aid completion rate and you may be required to pay back a portion of your aid.
