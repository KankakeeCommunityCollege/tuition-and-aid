### What is the Pell Eligibility Date?
{: .typography__h3 }

The Pell Eligibility Date is the day that the Office of Financial Aid takes a “snapshot” of your total enrollment. This “snapshot” locks in how many eligible credit hours your Pell grant enrollment intensity will be based upon. The Pell Eligibility Date applies to all courses, even those beginning later in the semester.

#### When is the Pell Eligibility Date?
{: .typography__h4 }

Pell Eligibility Dates are:

* Summer 2025 semester – June 13, 2025
* Fall 2025 semester – Sept. 5, 2025
* Spring 2026 semester – Jan. 30, 2026
* Summer 2026 semester – June 11, 2026

#### What does the Pell Eligibility Date mean to me?

When you finalize your schedule by the Pell Eligibility Date, you receive the most aid possible. All enrollment changes (adding, dropping, or withdrawing a class) before the Pell Eligibility Date affect your Pell grant enrollment intensity and consequently your award amount.

* If you drop/withdraw courses before the Eligibility Date: Your Pell grant enrollment intensity will be recalculated to exclude those courses.
* If you add courses after the Eligibility Date: The new classes will not be included in your enrollment intensity calculation. This means your Pell grant will NOT increase.

#### Are exceptions ever made to the Pell Eligibility Date policy?

Yes, exceptions may be made under certain circumstances, such as a course cancellation, if you were not awarded until after the Pell Eligibility Date, or if you registered after the Pell Eligibility Date. See the Office of Financial Aid to see if you are eligible to complete a Pell Eligibility Date appeal.
