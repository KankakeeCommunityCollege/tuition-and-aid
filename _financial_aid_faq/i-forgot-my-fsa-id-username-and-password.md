You must use your FSA ID to complete the FAFSA each year.

If you have forgotten your FSA ID â€‹username or password, you can visit the [Manage My FSA ID page](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } for help.

You can also call the Federal Processor at 1-800-4-FED-AID.
