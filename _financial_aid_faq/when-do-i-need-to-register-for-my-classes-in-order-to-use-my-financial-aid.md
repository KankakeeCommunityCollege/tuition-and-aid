question: "When do I need to register for my classes in order to use my financial aid?"
order: 6
---

* You must register by the financial aid eligibility dates
  * The financial aid *[eligibility date](https://www.kcc.edu/tuition-and-aid/financial-aid/#financial-aid-faq)* is the day that the Office of Financial Aid takes a "snapshot" of your total enrollment to determine your Title&nbsp;IV* federal award eligibility for the semester. This "snapshot" locks in the number of eligible credit hours upon which your financial aid award is based.
  * The eligibility date applies to all courses, even those beginning later in the semester.
  * Courses added after, or dropped before, the eligibility date will not count towards your financial aid enrollment
