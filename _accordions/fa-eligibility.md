### Maintaining Financial Aid Eligibility
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

To maintain your eligibility to receive financial aid once you are enrolled at KCC, you must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements:

* Maintain the grade point average specified in the academic regulations in KCC's college catalog. The required GPA is based on the number of credit hours you have attempted.
* Maintain a completion rate of 67% for all hours attempted.
* Complete the program you started before attempting more than 150% of the hours required.

This 150% is determined through the calculation of "attempted hours":

* All courses taken at KCC and all transfer courses credited at KCC.
* Courses in which you remain enrolled at the end of the tuition refund period each semester, even if you later withdraw from these courses.
* Courses which are of a remedial or prerequisite nature.
* If you change your program of study at KCC, you still will be evaluated under the 150% time frame established for your original program unless a Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal is approved. Consult a KCC advisor.

For further information, please refer to your [Satisfactory Academic Progress](https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/FinancialAid/SatisfactoryAcademicProgress){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;(SAP) status and the [KCC SAP Policy](../uploads/satisfactory-academic-progress-policy.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
