Three types of financial assistance make up the majority of aid provided by the federal government and the state of Illinois: grant assistance, loan assistance and work-study assistance.

### Grants
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

Grants are forms of financial assistance that do not have to be repaid. They are provided for students from limited-income families.

#### Pell Grant
{: .typography__h5.links__offset}

This is a federally funded program that provides assistance for any educational expenses based on need, academic load, length of enrollment and cost of education. Awards range from $652 to $6,195 per year.

#### Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)
{: .typography__h5.links__offset}

This is a federally funded program for students who demonstrate exceptional need and are Pell-eligible. Awards range from $150 to $600 per year and can be used for any educational expense.

#### MAP Grant
{: .typography__h5.links__offset}

This is a state-funded program that provides assistance toward the cost of tuition and service fees. Awards range from $294 to $2,880 per year and fluctuate as funding runs out. It is extremely important to apply as early as possible for this award since funds are limited. The Illinois Student Assistance Commission(ISAC) is suspending the announcement of 2019-20 Monetary Awards Program (MAP) grants for all students whose initial 2019-20 FAFSA is received by the Central Processing System (CPS) on or after April 29, 2019.

### Loans
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

Loans are federally funded sources of assistance that must be repaid with interest. Please refer to the Department of Education's publication [Federal Student Loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for further information regarding Federal Student Loans.

#### Federal Stafford Student Loan
{: .typography__h5.links__offset}

Students may qualify for a "subsidized" Federal Stafford Loan based on financial need. Students may qualify for an "unsubsidized" Federal Stafford Loan regardless of other criteria.

Dependent students may borrow up to $5,500 as freshmen for full-time enrollment and sophomores up to $6,500 for full-time enrollment. Independent students may borrow up to $9,500 as freshmen and sophomores up to $10,500 (again for full-time enrollment). Loans are prorated for 3/4 time and half-time enrollment each term. These loans are repaid starting six months after you graduate from college, leave school or drop below half-time student status.

Students who are enrolled half-time, meet standards of satisfactory progress and meet need requirements may be eligible for these loans. The interest rate for Federal Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2018, will increase from 4.45 percent to 5.045 percent for undergraduate Direct Loans. KCC's Loan Policy is available in the Financial Aid Forms section of this website. Click on the "Financial Aid Forms" tab to get more information under the Stafford/PLUS loans section.

#### Federal PLUS Loan

These loans provide for parents who want to borrow to help pay for their child's education. The interest rate for plus loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2018, will increase from 7 percent to 7.595 percent. A Parent PLUS Loan Application is available by contacting the KCC Office of Financial Aid. Parents must also request a PLUS Loan at www.studentloans.gov for an updated credit report to be considered.

### Work Study
