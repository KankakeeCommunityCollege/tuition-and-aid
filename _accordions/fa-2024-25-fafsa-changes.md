The *[FAFSA Simplification Act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46909){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' }* represents a significant overhaul of the processes and systems used to award federal student aid starting with the 2024–25 award year. This includes the *Free Application for Federal Student Aid* (FAFSA&reg;) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in federal student aid programs.

The law will also affect every state that uses FAFSA data to award state grant aid and every school that participates in the federal student aid&nbsp;programs.

Major changes required by the law include the following:
{: .mb-1}
1. Replacing the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) With the Student Aid Index (SAI)
2. Modifications to Family Definitions in FAFSA® Formulas
3. Expanding Access to Federal Pell Grants
4. Streamlining the FAFSA® Form
