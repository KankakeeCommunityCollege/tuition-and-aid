Whether you are hoping to receive grants, looking for student employment or need a student loan, follow these steps to apply for financial aid:

### 1\. Apply to KCC

[Complete the admissions application](https://kccedu.force.com/portal/TX_SiteLogin?startURL=/portal/TargetX_Base__Portal){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. A KCC admissions form must be on file in order for us to complete your financial aid file.

### 2\. Create a Federal Student Aid Identification (FSA ID)

[Create your FSA ID](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Your FSA ID is used to confirm your identity when accessing your financial aid information and electronically signs your federal student aid documents.

Students, parents and borrowers are required to use an FSA ID. If you are a parent with more than one child attending college, you will have one FSA ID and each student will have his/her own FSA ID.

### 3\. Complete a FAFSA

[File your FAFSA electronically](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, using KCC's Title IV school code 007690. It will speed up the process considerably.

If you don't have internet access at home, computer terminals are available on campus in Student Services and Financial Aid. You can also submit electronically from KCC's North and South extension centers, local libraries and high schools.
