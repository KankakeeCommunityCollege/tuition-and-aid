**In-district** residency is defined as living in <a href="" class="btn btn-link disabled" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true">KCC's service area</a>, Community College District 520.

**Residents of Benton, Lake and Newton counties** in Indiana are charged the Illinois out-of-district rate for tuition rather than the out-of-state rate.

**Senior citizens** (60 years and older) residing within the college district will not be charged any tuition for credit division courses provided sufficient tuition-paying students are enrolled in the class to cover the cost of offering it. Senior citizens also must pay any individual course fee required.
