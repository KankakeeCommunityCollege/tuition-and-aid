{: .typography__h4.links__offset}

To pay online, sign in to the [self-service module](https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/Student?hideProxyDialog%3dfalse&amp;hideProxyDialog=false){: target="_blank"} - choose Student Finance, then Make a Payment. Payments must be made in full with a credit card.

##### Nelnet Payment Plan
{: .typography__h4.links__offset}

For your convenience, we offer the Nelnet online payment plan for tuition and fees. After you sign up for Nelnet, tuition and fees are automatically deducted from your checking or savings account or credit card. Payments are spread over several months. Nelnet is not a loan program. There are no interest or finance charges. A non-refundable enrollment fee is charged each semester.

###### Before You Sign Up
{: .typography__h5.links__offset}

**Initial Account Balance** — Tuition and fees must total at least $195 per semester to enroll in the payment plan. You must re-enroll each semester.

**Balance Changes** — Your Nelnet contract will be calculated based on current charges at time of enrollment. If you add or remove courses after you enroll in an Nelnet contract, your charges will be **automatically updated**.

You must report changes (to adjust/cancel scheduled payments) due to financial aid approval, scholarship payment, etc. to KCC's Accounting Office a minimum of 10 business days before the Nelnet automatic withdrawal date.

**Payment Plan Enrollment Dates** — KCC tuition due dates and payment plan enrollment dates are NOT the same. You must complete a payment plan agreement before the last day to pay for preregistered classes. Failure to do so may result in you being dropped from your classes for non-payment.

###### Start a Payment Plan

#### Payment Policy
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

You must pay for your classes in full by the published payment deadlines. KCC does not deregister students from courses for non-payment after the refund date for a class. It is your responsibility to drop a class by the refund date or you will be obligated to pay for it.

Pending or partial financial aid and scholarships may hold you in your classes. Please review your registration statement for exact refund dates. Dropping classes may affect your financial aid.

Course refund dates are listed on your registration statement, viewable by logging into the [self-service module](https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/Student?hideProxyDialog%3dfalse&amp;hideProxyDialog=false){: target="_blank"} and choosing Student Planning.

#### Refunds
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

Tuition refunds for credit division courses are based on the date of withdrawal. If the final day for a refund falls on a weekend or a date when the college is closed, the refund deadline is the following business day.

#### Course Withdrawals
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

Tuition refunds for withdrawals from college credit division courses are based on refund date. Refund dates are printed on your registration statement. You can receive a 100 percent refund through 10 percent of the course (approximately 12 calendar days for a 16-week course). No refund will be given if you [withdraw](https://www.kcc.edu/academics/register/#cancellations-withdrawals-and-refunds) after 10 percent of the course has been completed.

#### Course Cancellation
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

You will receive a 100% refund of tuition and fees for a canceled course unless you transfer to another class. In that case, the tuition and fees will be applied to the new course.
