### Tuition and cost to attend
{: .typography__h3.links__offset}

KCC is committed to making your education as affordable as possible. Tuition is currently $150 per credit hour, plus $19 in fees, for a total of $169 per credit hour. Additional course fees apply to some courses. This amount is thousands of dollars less than what you would pay at four-year colleges, universities and for-profit institutions – and you still get a great education that will [pay off throughout your working life](https://news.kcc.edu/archive/2021/10/01/study-affirms-earnings-bump-for-community-college-grads/).&nbsp;

Rates are subject to change without notice.

[Financial aid](./financial-aid/), including grants, loans, scholarships and student employment, is also available. There is also an [installment payment plan available from Nelnet](https://www.kcc.edu/tuition-and-aid/#tuition-payment-and-deadlines). It has a non-refundable enrollment fee each semester, but no other interest or finance charges.

Your cost for classes will be based on how many credit hours you take each semester. A full-time student should take 15-16 credit hours each semester to complete an associate degree in two years.

**In-district** residency is defined as living in [KCC's service area](../about/#service-area-and-residency), Community College District 520.&nbsp;**Senior citizens** (60 years and older) residing within the college district will not be charged any tuition for credit division courses provided sufficient tuition-paying students are enrolled in the class to cover the cost of offering it. Senior citizens still pay individual course fees.

**\*Residents of Benton, Lake and Newton counties** in Indiana are charged the Illinois out-of-district rate for tuition rather than the out-of-state rate.
